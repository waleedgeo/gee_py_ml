This repository contains materials for the workshop on Google Earth Engine Python API for ML-based Classification.

Welcome to the most comprehensive workshop on using the Google Earth Engine Python API for machine learning-based classification! If you're interested in remote sensing, geospatial analysis, or machine learning applied to Earth observation data, this workshop is a must-watch.

In the first half of the workshop, I provide a solid foundation by discussing the background of Google Earth Engine and its Python API. I also cover the benefits of using Python for Earth Engine, explore various learning resources, and guide you through setting up your development environment for seamless coding.

The latter part of the workshop is dedicated to a hands-on coding session, where I showcase practical examples using Google Colab. This workshop will walk you through the process of implementing supervised classification techniques in Earth Engine, leveraging machine learning algorithms to extract valuable insights from satellite imagery.

Topics Covered:
- Why use the Python API for Google Earth Engine?
- Learning the Earth Engine Python API
- Setting up your environment
- Machine Learning Overview
- Supervised Classification in Earth Engine
